Hello World! And Hello GitHub. This is my first time using Git and GitHub.
I'm on my journey to become a full-stack dev. I'm already a game dev(to a certain level), and I thought that it would be nice to challenge myself and learn a new thing :)
BTW, I'm suprised that I didn't had any permission problems with WSL while making all of this Git thing

This file will also explain how a commit should be made.
First things firts, separate the commit in two sections: Subject and Body.
The subject should be around 50 characters long, and should contain what was changed in imperative mood. "Add description on commits"
The body should describe what and why was changed, and should be wrapped in 72 characters.
Subject and Body should be separated by a blank line. Subject should not end in a period.
